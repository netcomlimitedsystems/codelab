### 🗺️ Project Implementation Roadmap

Here is a suggested roadmap to guide your development process from scratch to deployment.

#### 🔰 Phase 1: Learn the Core Technologies
Before building, ensure you have the necessary skills. The following free courses are excellent starting points:
- **Try Django — Python Web Development**: A highly-rated free course for beginners to get started with Django.
- **Python Django Web Framework — Full Course for Beginners**: A comprehensive freeCodeCamp course covering most Django concepts.
- **Building Web Applications in Django**: A free Coursera course from the University of Michigan that's part of a larger specialization.

#### 🏗️ Phase 2: Build Your First Django & Bootstrap Project
Apply your skills by building a smaller project first. This helps you understand the integration of Django's back-end with Bootstrap's front-end.
- **Follow a Guided Project**: Courses like "**Django 5 – Build a Complete Website from Scratch to Deploy**" teach you to build a real-world website using a Bootstrap 5 template, control the front-end with Django's template language, and handle deployment.
- **Key Integration Skills**: You'll learn to handle static files (CSS, JS, images), use Django's templating language to make dynamic Bootstrap pages, and structure your project for growth.

#### 🚀 Phase 3: Develop and Deploy "CodeLab"
Once comfortable with Django and Bootstrap, you can start building CodeLab's specific features.
1.  **Project Setup**: Initialize your Django project, set up a virtual environment, and install necessary packages.
2.  **Core App Development**: Create Django apps for `users`, `courses`, and `payments`. Design your data models (e.g., `Course`, `Lesson`, `Enrollment`, `UserProfile`) and set up the admin interface.
3.  **Front-End Styling**: Use Bootstrap components to build a responsive and user-friendly interface. Create a base template (e.g., `base.html`) with a navigation bar and footer that other templates extend.
4.  **Deployment**: Use platforms like **PythonAnywhere** or **Heroku** to deploy your website to the internet.

### 💡 Advanced Functionality and Further Learning
As your project grows, you might need more advanced features:
- **Django REST Framework**: If you plan to build a more dynamic front-end or a mobile app, learning the Django REST Framework is the next step. The "**Advanced Django: Introduction to Django Rest Framework**" course on Coursera is designed for this purpose.
- **Explore Other Tech Stacks**: For reference, the real Coursera platform uses a tech stack that includes **React.js** for the front-end and **Scala, Python, and Django** on the back-end.
